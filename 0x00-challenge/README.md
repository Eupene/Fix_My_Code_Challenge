Background

The essence of Fix My Code revolves around the challenge of identifying and addressing issues within code. This project introduces an assortment of existing codebases, some of which you might be familiar with, and others that might be new to you. Regardless of your familiarity with the language, the objective remains the same: fixing the code to ensure its proper functionality.

To get started, you can download the initial files for all solutions from the repository 0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge. Rather than rewriting the entire code, the task is to focus on troubleshooting and improving the existing code.
